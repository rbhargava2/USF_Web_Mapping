This code repository serves as the course website for ENVM-680 Spring 2017, **Web Mapping**.  The class will provide students with a working knowledge of web-based mapping for a range of applications, including mapping election results, animating the geographic spread of disease, and styling maps of environmental information.  We will rely on the open-source [Carto](http://www.carto.com) platform.  Students will have the opportunity to create maps and learn about programmatic ways to query large-scale geospatial data, embed maps in blogs, and other modern techniques for analyzing and sharing geospatial information.  

#### Course information
----

- **Course meeting**: Room HR104, Wednesdays 6:30pm PT - 9:30pm PT
- **Instructor information**: Dan Hammer ([dan@earthgenome.org](mailto:dan@earthgenome.org)) Adjunct professor, Department of Environmental Science.  Zoom. 
- **Office hours**: By appointment
- **Course texts**: There is no book required for this class. All course material is hosted online, mainly within this repository.
- **Software**: The primary software is web-based and no license is required for course access.  Some courses will use Excel, just to demonstrate interoperability, but access to Excel is not required for the course.  The data files will be provided by the instructor.
- **Assignments**: Course readings and exercises will be assigned after the associated lecture. I highly suggest you read the material and complete the computer assignments for you own benefit, but only a few, selected assignments will be submitted for a grade.
- **Evaluation**: A letter grade will be assessed at the end of the course, based on course participation (10%), four problem sets (60%), and a final project (30%).
- **Academic honesty**: The University of San Francisco expects the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. This precludes engaging in, causing, or benefiting from any aspects of cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarism (intentionally or knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as oneâ€™s own in any academic exercise), forgery, multiple submissions of the same paper, or any other such activities are not in accord with professional ethics and behavior. Any assignment found not to be in the student's own words will be marked zero.
